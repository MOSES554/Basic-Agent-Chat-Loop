### Immediate (QA Findings)
- [x] **HIGH-001:** ~~Add missing type hints throughout codebase~~
  - ✅ Fixed: Added type hints (mypy reports 0 errors)

  - ✅ Fixed `token_tracker.py` - Added `List[Tuple[int, int]]` annotation

- [x] **HIGH-003:** ~~Improve error handling - no silent failures~~
  - ✅ Fixed: Changed bare `except:` to `except Exception:`
  - Note: Silent failures intentional for config loading (fallback to defaults)

- [x] **HIGH-004:** ~~Extract magic numbers to named constants~~
  - ✅ Fixed: Extracted all magic numbers to named constants
  - ✅ `ui_components.py` - Added `TOKEN_THOUSANDS_THRESHOLD` and `TOKEN_MILLIONS_THRESHOLD` class constants

  - ✅ `agent_loader.py` - Added `ENV_SEARCH_DEPTH` module constant
  - ✅ All 158 tests passing after changes

- [x] **MEDIUM-002:** ~~Fix logging configuration~~
  - ✅ Fixed: Uses named logger "basic_agent_chat_loop" instead of root logger
  - ✅ No longer interferes with other libraries' logging

- [x] **MEDIUM-004:** ~~Fix cost display duplication bug~~
  - ✅ Fixed: Removed duplicate cost display, now shows session total only

- [x] ~~Run ruff check and fix all issues~~
  - ✅ Completed: 21 errors auto-fixed, 11 files reformatted
  - ✅ Fixed unused imports, bare except, unused variables
  - Note: 8 minor E501 line-length warnings remain (acceptable)

- [x] ~~Run black formatter~~
  - ✅ Completed via ruff format

- [x] ~~Run mypy type checking~~
  - ✅ Completed: All 12 source files pass with 0 errors

- [ ] Remove any TODO/FIXME comments in code

### Code Review
- [x] **MEDIUM-006:** ~~Review error messages for information leakage~~
  - ✅ Fixed: Error messages now show only filenames, not full paths
  - ✅ Sanitized all error messages in agent_loader.py
- [x] **HIGH-006:** ~~Verify cross-platform path handling~~
  - ✅ Verified: All paths use pathlib.Path (cross-platform)
  - ✅ Clear screen command checks os.name for Windows/Unix
  - ✅ readline optional with pyreadline3 support for Windows
- [ ] **SECURITY-001:** Review .env file loading behavior
